<!-- # About me -->

I am a software engineer, building mostly software for the web.

I have worked with various tech stacks. But I am currently building apps with golang and GCP.

This blog is for documenting my findings which at some point may be useful to anyone who stumbles on it or myself in the future.

You will find most of my open source work on [*_Github_*](https://github.com/spankie).
